		<h1>“	We have faced far worse than this one fallen mortal. But we are the gods! We who the mortals worship. We who rule over this land. We who will not be swept aside by this petulant fool! Brothers, put aside the petty grievances that have splintered us for so long. We will unite. We will stand together. And I will wipe out this plague! Olympus... will prevail!	”
–Zeus to his fellow gods, Poseidon, Hades, Helios and Hermes.

Zeus (Greek: Ζεύς/Δίας) was the King of Olympus and the ruler of the Greek Pantheon, as well as the God of the Sky, Thunder, Lightning, Storms, Hospitality and Heavens. Youngest son of the Titans Cronos and Rhea, he was the brother of Hades, Poseidon as well as Demeter, Hestia and Hera - whom he would also wed. He fathered a line of all powerful deities such as Ares, Athena, Hermes and Hephaestus as well as many illegitimate children such as Hercules, Kratos, Deimos and Perseus.

Destined to overthrow his mighty father and bring forth the reign of the Olympians, Zeus rescued his siblings from Cronos and engaged the Titans into a cataclysmic conflict that would shape the Greek World itself. Victorious thanks to the superior powers of the Gods and the Blade of Olympus, Zeus banished the Titans into the Tartarus for eternity, while he would decide the fate of the world with his brothers Hades and Poseidon. Zeus would ultimately get the lion share by becoming the King of the Gods. However, the Great War against the Titans also unleashed the most dangerous evils upon the world, and Zeus commanded his son Hephaestus the creation of the legendary Pandora's Box, powerful enough to contain them.

Born from the depths of the Underworld and rooted in the River Styx, the mighty Mount Olympus emerged out of the Chaos and was to become the golden heaven from where Zeus now ruled over both his fellow gods and mortals alike, a testament of his new power as the Ruler of Olympus and God of the Sky. He notably oversaw the creation of the Chain of Balance who further linked the fate of the Underworld to Olympus itself, and commanded the creation of Pandora's Temple on the very back of Cronos in order to protect the Pandora's Box, on the advice of Hephaestus.

Zeus is introduced in God of War (2005) as a minor supportive character under the guise of the Grave Digger, notably giving Kratos the means to escape the Underworld. He also grants the Spartan a fraction of his godly powers in the form of Zeus' Fury, and witnesses the Ghost of Sparta becoming the new God of War when the latter is offered the seat of Ares. But the opening of the Pandora's Box had dire consequences upon the Pantheon as a whole and Zeus himself fell prey to one of the evils contained within; Fear itself. A fear of the marked warrior foretold the destruction of Olympus.

This is why Zeus then returns in God of War II as the main antagonist of the series. Now aware of the threat posed by his son, the King of the Gods tricked Kratos into giving up most of his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus to allow him defeat the mighty Colossus of Rhodes. Taking advantage of the severely weakened Spartan, Zeus demanded unwavering loyalty - a request deemed unacceptable by Kratos. The King of Olympus then promptly killed the Ghost of Sparta, promising him that he would never challenge Zeus' power.

However, Kratos managed to change his fate with the help of the Titans and by defeating the Sisters of Fate, returning back in time to prevent his death at the hands of Zeus. The latter engaged the Ghost of Sparta in a fierce duel that would have ended by the death of Zeus, had Athena not intervened to sacrifice herself. The King of the Gods forcefully fled to Olympus and urged his brothers to fight in what would become known as the Second Titanomachy. Zeus makes his final appearance in God of War III, uniting all of Olympus against Kratos and the Titans in a desperate attempt to change the course of history. He notably witnesses his fellow brothers and gods fall one after the others at the hands of his son, unleashing waves of cataclysms upon the Greek World in the process. Zeus confronts his son for the control of Pandora, but following an absolutely brutal fight he ironically ends up impaled by the very blade he used to kill the Spartan.

But the King of Olympus wasn't going down that easily, and under his astral form he finally overpowered Kratos, using fear to annihilate his opponent. However, the latter had deep inside him a power that Zeus could not fight off: Hope. Understanding that everything was lost and having given up the will to fight his son, Zeus finally accepted his fate and merely let Kratos beat him to death, paying the ultimate price for the countless and unforgivable mistakes of a depraved and dysfunctional family. The death of Zeus unleashed complete Chaos upon the Greek World, now without purpose and in a state of utter destruction. However, the demise of Olympus combined with the power of Hope released by Kratos upon the survivors paved the way for the rebirth of a world without deities.
Greek Mythology
In Greek Mythology, Zeus was the King of the Gods, ruler of Olympus, and God of the Sky, Heavens, and Lightning. Zeus was youngest of his six siblings. His symbols were the Lightning bolt, the Eagle, the Oak Tree and the Bull. Zeus was the youngest son of Cronos and Rhea. He was very well known for his erotic escapades with beautiful mortal women, resulting in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Hephaestus, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Hercules, Helen and Minos. When the loss of his older siblings by their father Cronos became too great for Rhea to bare any longer, she hid him from Cronos far away, giving him a stone to swallow instead. Once grown, the young God sought to free his siblings and overthrow his father. Disguised as a cup-bearer, Zeus mixed a brew into Cronos' wine, causing him to vomit up the stone that had taken his place, and then his siblings. Overthrowing the Titans, Zeus castrated Cronos and banished him to Tartarus. Later drawing lots with his brothers Poseidon and Hades to determine who would rule the skies, oceans, and the Underworld, Zeus won the sky, and becae the King of Olympus
