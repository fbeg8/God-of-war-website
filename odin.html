		<h3>	Everyone's got me all wrong. You think war drives me? Power? Wealth? Naw. Never have. Know what drives me? What I really want? I want answers. Same as you. See, mortals have it easy. When they push up against life's big questions, they can look to us to give them meaning. Divine comfort. We both know that's a sham. But when we have questions? Why are we here? To give meaning to mortals while living without it ourselves? No. We're more than that.	”
–Odin to Atreus

Odin (Old Norse: Óðinn, Nordic: ᛟᛞᛁᚾ), also known as the All-Father, was the King of the Aesir and the ruler of the Norse Pantheon. He is the eldest son of Borr and Bestla, the brother of Vili, Vé and Hœnir, the father of Thor, Týr, Heimdall and Baldur, grandfather of Magni, Modi, Forseti and Thrúd, and ex-husband of Fjörgyn, Hróðr, Blóðughadda and Frigg.

Convinced in his youth of the racial superiority of the Aesir over the Jötnar, Odin drew the first blood when he slew the legendary Ymir after a climactic duel, and claimed the title of All-Father while crowning himself King of the Aesir. Promised to a certain death but determined to change his fate, Odin waged countless wars against the Nine Realms and managed to bring them all under Asgard's ascendancy. The All-Father reached the peak of his power after the inconclusive Aesir-Vanir War when he married the Vanir Freya. Their union brought peace and a relative prosperity as the King of the Aesir became genuinely fond of his wife, who managed to soothe his belligerent mood.

But as time passed, Odin grew more and more paranoid and progressively turned on his closest advisors. Neglecting Freya, he spent a great deal of time trying to unfold the secrets of life and death in a fruitless attempt to change his fate, ruthlessly robbing the realms from their sacred knowledge and collecting even more godly titles. The All-Father then commanded the infamous genocide against the people who prophesied his final demise, yet another demonstration of his limitless depravity. His actions finally turned the Vanir goddess against him, and an outraged Odin cursed his former love by banishing her to Midgard for eternity, while robbing her from her warrior spirit. The All-Father then sealed the access to some key realms through Týr's Temple and started fortifying Asgard in preparation for Ragnarök. In Svartalfheim, he personally commanded the delivery of war machines and went as far as cursing the Valkyries, condemning them to certain madness.

Working behind the scenes, the All-Father is the perpetrator behind the events of God of War (2018), eventually setting the events of the series into motion by sending his tracker find the Guardian at Kratos' Cabin. The King of the Aesir remains absent throughout the whole game but his shadow covers the main protagonists as they slowly but surely make their way to Jötunheim. The death of Baldur at the hands of Kratos, which triggers Fimbulwinter - and thus the beginning of Ragnarök - forces Odin to come to the fore as the main antagonist of God of War Ragnarök. Having had time to study Kratos and learn what the Ghost of Sparta did in his homeland and, more importantly, that Atreus was secretly seeking the fallen Norse God of War, Odin decided it was time to take a more cunning - and vicious - approach.

Introducing himself as a benevolent person, Odin sought a status quo with the Spartan and his son by offering peace and inaction in exchange Though his offer was rebuffed by Kratos, the All-Father slowly but surely drives a wedge between the two of them by using Atreus' innate gift in ancient languages to his own benefit, convinced that the young man is the key to break free of his fate. Ever omniscient, he successfully fools his enemies under the guise of Týr, allowing him to constantly stay one step ahead before being exposed in extremis. As the realms unite against him under the leadership of the Spartan, he is unable to prevent Ragnarök from happening, though the events don't exactly go as prophesied. The All-Father first promptly kills the God of Thunder before personally engaging Kratos, Atreus and Freya in a last ditch attempt to save his crumbling kingdom, only to find himself on his knees. He ultimately meets his end in the arms of his former protégé. His captured soul was eventually destroyed by Sindri.



Norse Mythology
Odin (pronounced “OH-din”; Old Norse Óðinn, Old English and Old Saxon Woden, Old High German Wuotan, Wotan, or Wodan, Proto-Germanic *Woðanaz, “Master of Ecstasy”) is one of the most complex and enigmatic characters in Norse mythology, and perhaps in all of world literature. He’s the ruler of the Aesir tribe of deities, yet he often ventures far from their kingdom, Asgard, on long, solitary wanderings throughout the cosmoson purely self-interested quests. He’s a relentless seeker after and giver of wisdom, but he has little regard for communal values such as justice, fairness, or respect for law and convention. He’s the divine patron of rulers, and also of outlaws. He’s a war-god, but also a poetry-god, and he has prominent “effeminate” qualities that would have brought unspeakable shame to any historical Viking warrior. He’s worshiped by those in search of prestige, honor, and nobility, yet he’s often cursed for being a fickle trickster.

Odin’s name can be translated as “Master of Ecstasy.” His Old Norse name, Óðinn, is formed from two parts: first, the noun óðr, “ecstasy, fury, inspiration,” and the suffix -inn, the masculine definite article, which, when added to the end of another word like this, means something like “the master of” or “a perfect example of.” The eleventh-century historian Adam of Bremen confirms this when he translates “Odin” as “The Furious.” Óðr can take countless different forms. As one saga describes Odin, “when he sat with his friends, he gladdened the spirits of all of them, but when he was at war, his demeanor was terrifyingly grim.”

One of Odin’s countless names is “Allfather” (Old Norse Alfaðir), “because,” according to Snorri Sturluson, “he is the father of all of the gods.” And, as we’ve already noted, Odin is listed as the divine ancestor of countless families from all over northern Europe. He’s simultaneously an Aesir god, a Vanir god (the Vanir god Odr is only an extension or transposition of Odin), and a giant (his mother is Bestla, one of the first frost-giants). One Old Norse poem even identifies him with önd, the breath of life.

Codex Description
“	Like his son before him, Odin has come to our door. He does not seek vengeance for Baldur, but instead he speaks of peace and inaction. Odin claims that Atreus has been searching for Týr and has requested he halt this endeavour. I am not pleased that he knows more about what my son is doing than I. While I do not approve of what Atreus has done behind my back, I will not abide the gods of this realm coming to my home and dictating our actions. If he does not want us searching for Týr, it is likely that it is exactly what we should be doing. I must note that he offered a deal of peace for our inaction. If I did not have better counsel, I would have been tempted to take it. His threat to Freya made this impossible. She may persist as a danger, but to ally against her with her former husband is... unacceptable.	”
–Kratos

“	After all the terrible things I've heard about Odin, I never expected him to be so... respectful of me. Back at the cabin, when he invited me to Asgard, and since arriving here, he seems genuinely interested to know who I am and what I think. I know I can't trust him too far... but it's nice to be listened to. I feel safer around him than I thought I would. Let's see what answers he has for me...	”
–Atreus

In the God of War Series
Backstory
Odin was a grandson of Búri the first of the Aesir gods, who had sprung from Ymir, the first Giant and father of all life and one of the sons of Borr. However, unlike Ymir, Odin felt that the Aesir were fit to be the supreme rulers of the Nine Realms and so he, along with his brothers Vili and Vé killed Ymir and anyone else who stood in their path, with Odin himself taking the place of the "All-Father", after that, Ymir's blood drowned all Jötnar, except Bergelmir and his wife. Odin would then create the realm of Midgard from Ymir’s torn flesh. Eventually, Odin would create the first Humans; Ask and Embla.

The moment Ymir was slain by Odin, it caused the creation of a reality tear, which caught the eye of Odin. After suffering a bout of existentialism, he came to realize that there is much more to them than the Nine Realms. With this realization, he began a massive research project to discover the secrets of the reality tear. This was also the beginning of his obsessive nature regarding knowledge, as he began aggressively gathering more knowledge and developed a great capacity and determination for learning. Around this time he built the realm of Asgard and declare himself king of the Aesir. He even cemented this with a Grand Lodge that he built above the reality tear and a research complex underneath the Grand Lodge where he would began gathering more wisdom across the Nine Realms.

Seeing the need to expand Asgard's forces, he seized control of Valhalla and the nine Valkyries who oversaw it despite the best efforts of their Queen to prevent this. He would go on to use Valhalla's endless supply of deceased individuals to create an endless supply of superhuman soldiers for the Asgardian military. This was part of his future plans to try and thwart Ragnarök, a prophesied catastrophic event that would lead to an apocalypse and the deaths of most of the Norse Gods. To prepare for this impending threat, Odin would permit only the greatest warriors who had died in battle to enter Valhalla to one day serve as his own personal army: the Valkyries serving as his recruiters and trainers in that respect. Everyone else he relegated to the icy wasteland known as Helheim.

For a time, Odin performed ritual by impaling his own spear and hanged himself from the tree of Yggdrasil's branches, and bled down into the Well of Destiny, While he spent for nine days as a dead, he roamed the realms of the dead and plundered the secrets of the World Tree. Until his limit, he was sent back to the land of the living, much to his angered and madness.

At some point, Mimir came to Odin with Mimisbrunnr, a "Mystic Well of Knowledge" but it was really a well laced with enough magic mushrooms to give even a God as powerful as him visions. Odin was initially so impressed with this well that whatever he saw in his hallucinations made him start to tear out both of his eyes. Fortunately, he was stopped by Mimir from finishing the job and was convinced by Mimir that he had sacrificed his eye for knowledge. However, Odin instantly figured out that Mimir had fooled him but allowed him to become his adviser due to his immense intelligence. After he imprisoned his adviser, Odin removed one of Mimir's eyes and tortured him on a daily basis. Odin also searched for Brok and Sindri to construct a Statue of Thor within which to hide Mimir's severed eye. The Dwarves refused but were still forced to construct the statue.

Around this time, Odin also began marrying women and expanding his family, hoping to gain strong children. At some point during this quest, he sought out the Giant Skaði's hand in marriage, but when she rejected his affections, Odin tricked her into killing her own father out of pettiness, which inadvertently led to her succumbing to her fate. Odin also married the giantess Fjörgyn, with whom he had Thor. Sometime after Thor's birth, Fjörgyn mysteriously died, leaving Odin heartbroken and alone for many years. Despite his loneliness Odin ended up in the relationship with another giantess Hróðr who bore him Týr, and after that he was with goddess Blóðughadda who bore him Heimdall.

Odin at one point met the stone giant Hrungnir and was so amused by the latter's gullible nature that rather than killing him immediately Odin invited him to Asgard and made him drunk and goaded him into all manners of boasts and antics, even taking the threat of Hrungnir killing all the Aesir and taking all the women of Asgard back to Jötunheim as a joke. However, it came to an end after another fit of laughter upon Thor killing the stone giant and being crushed by his corpse and Odin ordered all his men to remove it from Thor but none of the Aesir was strong enough to do so and Thor himself was too drunk to remove the stone giant off him until Odin's grandchildren Magni and Modi came and freed Thor.

After cementing his rule as the "All-Father," Odin continued to wage wars against the other realms, defeating and subduing Alfheim, Svartalfheim and Niflheim; Muspelheim and Jotunheim remained beyond his reach. He did not encounter any real difficulties until he and the Aesir encountered the Vanir, an opposing tribe of Gods native to the realm of Vanaheim; the two forces fought endlessly until finally they reached a stalemate. At this point, both sides grew tired of fighting, and Odin eventually agreed to marry Freya to end the fighting, and so that Odin may secretly learn her magic. Together, they produced Odin's youngest son, Baldur. For a time, the two appeared to have greatly cared for one another, with Mimir noting that their relationship seemed to echo that of Odin and Fjörgyn's, with Odin treating her in a loving manner and conceding to most of her wishes, giving the Valkyries some freedom when she wished it.

However, Odin reveals to Freya his true nature and demanded that he give her the same protection spell that she bestowed on her son. When this was refused, this angered the All-Father greatly and he proceeded to trash her room, causing Freya to leave him. Odin then cursed her to remain imprisoned in Midgard and to never harm another living thing, even in self-defense, out of petty revenge. To ensure that she could never leave Midgard, Odin proceeded to tie and bind several roots of Yggdrasil together into a knot using his magic, as he knew that the dragon Níðhögg, the caretaker of the world tree, would protect its roots and prevent anyone from undoing the curse.

Odin also sought the secrets of Jötunheim and the Giants. His son Týr attempted to open relations between them by inviting Odin to a summit with the Giants, but Odin only agreed to steal the secrets of Jötunheim. The giants saw Odin's sinister intentions and expelled Odin from Jotunheim, banishing with a curse that prevented him from ever returning. In response, Odin began a genocidal campaign to slaughter any giant the Aesir could find. This proved too much for Týr, who turned against Odin to help the giants cut Jotunheim off from the other realms. For this betrayal, Odin had Týr imprisoned and spread rumour of his death, all in the hopes having a secret war god would prove to be of use someday.

God of War (2018)
While not actually making an appearance in the game, he is frequently mentioned by several characters. He is the one who imprisoned Mimir in the past and personally tortured him every day. He also sent Baldur to gain knowledge of Faye's whereabouts, as the Giantess has been a thorn in the Aesir's side for quite some time. He employs a large number of icy ravens (known as Eyes of Odin) to observe the world and gather information for him. Odin also has secret vaults scattered throughout the world that contain murals depicting legends, and an entrance to a Valkyrie's prison.

God of War Ragnarök
Odin has long been aware of the presence of this foreigner god in Midgard and the threat he could pose to his authority, but chose not to intervene personally. However, the premature and unexpected death of Magni, then Modi and above all Baldur changed everything. His actions prematurely triggered Fimbulwinter and thus, Ragnarök itself. Aware of the Spartan's reputation and what he did in Greece, the All-Father could no longer ignore the danger. He needed to gain time and keep Kratos on the sideline, at least for the time being. He first started by locking any access to the Temple of Týr, then decided it was time to deal with the Ghost of Sparta.

Meeting with the Ghost of Sparta
<img src="D:\GOW OF WAR\odin 3.jpg"height="400px"><img><br><br>

Family Reunion

Three years after the beginning of Fimbulwinter, Odin showed up in the flesh with Thor to negotiate a status quo with Kratos and Atreus, secretly fearing what he considered to be a threat to his power. Aware of the precarious situation in which the Spartan and his son found themselves, caught between Fimbulwinter and Freya, the All-Father offered to forgive the blood debt the Aesir were owed for the death of Baldur while preventing Freya from hunting the two gods if, in return, they promised not to attack the Aesir again or seek out Týr. A simple "no" from Kratos was enough to provoke a brawl with Thor that sent the two brutes flying across Midgard. Odin took advantage of Kratos' absence to reveal to Atreus that he is no longer interested in Jötunheim and cordially invites him to Asgard for an apprenticeship before leaving. Lenient, he even offered to pay for the broken roof.

Master of deception

Odin disguised as Týr

Having tipped Kratos off to Atreus' search for Týr, Odin went to the realm last rumored to house his son, Svartalfheim, and disguised himself as the Norse God of War so as to gain the other war god's confidence. Lo and behold, they "rescued" Odin and escorted him to Sindri's hideaway between the Realms without a hint of the All-Father's true identity. He spent his time with them advising against taking action against Asgard under a guise of pacifism, lead them into battle while refusing to assist them, and even refused to accompany them at all after seeing a hidden giant prophesy about how Asgard, alone of all the Nine Realms, would be destroyed in Ragnarök.

The search for ultimate knowledge

Atreus and Odin

He watched with the rest of Sindri's guests as Atreus fled to go to Asgard. He found the privacy to grab the raven he had hidden in Sindri's closet and returned to Asgard as Odin just in time to stop Heimdall from killing Atreus. Odin showed Atreus his armies, the rooms of the Great Lodge, several generous gifts, and a broken mask. This mask had foreign languages only Atreus could read and a connection to a hole in reality Odin believed held the secrets to life's meaning and the afterlife of the gods. The next day, Odin sent Atreus, Thor, and Freyr's sentient sword to Muspelheim to locate a piece of the mask.

Second encounter with Kratos

Later, Odin takes Durlin with him to Kratos. When the Spartan threatened him with his newly forged spear, Odin reveals to him that Atreus is in Asgard and is doing well. After letting Durlin go, Odin tries to tell Kratos that he also wants peace as much as he does and that they could find it together. However, Mimir immediately saw through the All-father's lie, but Kratos already knew of it as he doesn't believe in Odin's words. When Odin tells Kratos that his son is the key to being free of fate and prophecy, the Spartan firmly tells him that Atreus is not a key. The All-father, knowing of who Kratos was, states to him that while he is not the god that he once was he has the chance to prove it again. When Kratos demanded that Atreus be returned to him under threat of facing what he once was, Odin heatedly asks him on what kind of god he would show and proceeded to ask if he ever knew about godhood, and if anyone had ever worshipped or prayed to him. He then mock the Spartan that he doesn't care for mortals beyond himself and the monster he once was. Just before departing, the All-father asks Kratos one last time, that if he fears he can never hope to understand, then he shouldn't wonder if Atreus will return to him before disappearing in a flock of ravens.

Revealing of the rift's origins

Back in Asgard, Odin gets into an argument with Thor in his private study on why he brought Atreus into Asgard and harshly sends him away. When Atreus arrives and asks Odin if his secret study room is the place where he killed Ymir, the All-Father reveals that the first giant was vessel of power and was a force of nature. He explained that in his youth, he was young and foolish and saw an opportunity to create something more in order to protect his own. In response to Atreus wondering on why he had built his great lodge on the very spot, Odin reveals that when he killed Ymir, he saw rift that is possibly the rift of reality, and when he looked inside there was something in there, whispering to him. When he thought that it was over and that he could no longer look into the rift, he found the piece of the mask and knew that it would let him see all the answers he longed for. Approaching the rift, Odin tells Atreus that he knows that there is something more and that he wants to know of his fate.

We all make mistakes
Capture d’écran 2022-12-06 à 21.35.40-min.png
When Atreus assumes that the next piece of the mask is in Helheim, Odin gives an order to Huginn and summons in Thrúd and Heimdall to accompany Atreus. Later, after Atreus and Thrúd freed the Hel hound Garm by accident, they immediately returned to Asgard with Heimdall, proceeded to report to Odin of what happened. A while later, he visited Atreus in his room and asked him on what happen. When the latter tells him that the last piece of the mask wasn't there in Helheim and that he himself was wrong, Odin assures him that [they] all make mistakes and that freeing Garm was a big mistake, since he is now spreading chaos into all the other realms, assuring Atreus that they are safe in Asgard. When Atreus wants to return to Sindri's house, Odin allows him to, asking him him to return the mask to him along with Ingrid, whom he does, the Allfather reminds him that if he is ready to resume his work, Huginn will be waiting for him at Kratos' cabin. Before Atreus disappears in a flock of ravens, Odin tells him to say "hi" to Mimir for him. Shortly after Atreus left, Odin resumes his disguise as Týr and goes back to Sindri's House.

Resuming the disguise
After Atreus helps his father and their allies in fending of the Hel-Walkers that were pouring out from rifts made by Garm, the disguised Odin arrives and, to prevent anyone from knowing that he has already known that Garm has been set free, pretended to be despondent and criticizes Atreus' actions, telling him that it was madness. Later, he greets Kratos and Atreus when they returned from stopping Garm. When he asks the duo of how it went, Kratos tells him that the giant wolf should no longer trouble them. When Atreus reveals to the others of Odin's obsession with the mask, the All-father, while in disguise, listens to Mimir scoffing that it is a fake and that Odin has been disorganizingly doing it for a really long time. After being given Atreus' journal, he proceeded to tell Mimir that he is wrong and though he reveals that while the Jötnar didn't create it, a few of them have seen it in their visions. Odin, while in the form of Týr, reveals that the giants don't know of the mask's origins but is said to gaze into the secrets of creation. When Kratos asks him if it's an oracle, he states that it is much more and imagine if becoming one with something that grants infinite knowledge. The disguised Odin then lies to Atreus that it is the reason why Odin tortured him. He then gives it Freya, who reveals that Odin never shared her this obsession and that while he speaks the truth, his purpose is usually false.

The second piece of the mask
Capture d’écran 2022-12-06 à 21.38.52-min.png
When Atreus returns to Asgard, he finds Odin reading a tome in his study room. Sensing Atreus, he reveals that Heimdall is dead and asks him if he knows anything about it. When Atreus states that Heimdall had struck Thrúd while in Helheim and that someone maybe found out and got even, Odin proceeded to ask him if Heimdall had something to do with it. In response to Atreus saying that he honestly doesn't know, the All-father claims that while he didn't believe that he didn't have anything to do with Heimdall's death he is glad that Atreus has returned. When Atreus reveals that he has misinterpreted the clue of the next location and that it actually means "the cry of first breath", Odin became enthusiastic as he immediately knew of the next location, and he tells Atreus to go find Thor so that he may accompany him while on the journey.

After Atreus retrieved the final piece of the mask in said location, which is the primordial realm of Niflheim, Odin arrives to congratulate him while at the same time ignoring Thor. However, shortly after, Sif suddenly arrives with the valkyries Hrist and Mist. When Odin demanded on why they have come, Sif reveals that Atreus' father Kratos had killed Heimdall, due to the evidence that Forseti had found. When Hrist and Mist were ordered to arrest Atreus, Odin comes to the latter's rescue and commands the two valkyries to leave him alone. The All-father then gets into an argument with Sif in which he dismisses her and proceeded to have a talk with Hrist and Mist. A few minutes later, when Thor was about to kill Atreus out of revenge for the deaths of his sons Modi and Magni, Odin tries to stop him, but Atreus was able to escape. Odin once again resumes his disguise and returns to Sindri's house via the raven he had in the closet.
