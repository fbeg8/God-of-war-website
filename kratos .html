<h2>Kratos (Ancient Greek: Κράτος lit. "strength"; Old Norse: Fárbauti [ˈfɑːrˌbɔute] lit. "cruel striker") is a fictional character and the protagonist of Santa Monica Studio's God of War series, based on Greek mythology and, later, Norse mythology. He first appeared in the 2005 video game God of War, which led to the development of eight additional titles featuring the character as the protagonist. Kratos also appears as the protagonist of the 2010 and 2018 comic series, as well as three novels that retell the events of three of the games. The character was voiced by Terrence C. Carson from 2005 to 2013,[3] with Christopher Judge taking over the role in 2018's continuation, also titled God of War. Antony Del Rio voiced the character as a child in God of War: Ghost of Sparta.<br>

Throughout the Greek era of the series, Kratos is portrayed as a Spartan warrior, who becomes known as the "Ghost of Sparta" after accidentally killing his family due to the trickery of his former mentor Ares, the God of War. He later avenges the deaths of his family and becomes the new "God of War" after killing Ares. Kratos is eventually revealed to be a demigod and the son of Zeus, who later betrays him. Kratos embarks on several adventures in attempts to avert disaster or to change his fate. He is usually portrayed as being oblivious to all else and is stoic, bloodthirsty, and arrogant in nature, often engaging in morally ambiguous activities and performing acts of extreme violence. However, he frequently questions himself, undergoes bouts of severe guilt and self-hate, even attempting suicide several times, and is generally portrayed as a tragic figure. Vengeance is a central theme of the Greek era, and installments focus on Kratos' origins and his relationships with his family and the Olympian gods. In the Norse era of the series, Kratos finds himself controlling his rage and learning how to truly be a father and mentor to his son, Atreus, helping him come to terms with his divinity. Along their journey, they combat monsters and gods of the Norse realm, of whom they make enemies, which inevitably leads to the catastrophic battle of Ragnarök.<br>

The God of War franchise is a flagship title for the PlayStation brand and Kratos is one of its most popular characters. The character has been well received by critics and has become a video game icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as Mario, Link, Sonic the Hedgehog, Lara Croft and Crash Bandicoot. The character is now associated with other products and has had various cameos in PlayStation games outside of the God of War series.<br>
Concept and design<br>
In designing Kratos, God of War (2005) creator and game director David Jaffe attempted to create a character that looked brutal, but did not resemble a typical traditional Greek hero.[4] The character would not wear traditional armor as Jaffe wanted him to be individualistic.[5] Although the idea of using a fully masked character was approved, the concept was abandoned as the design seemed soulless and lacked a defined personality.[6] Some models included unconventional elements, such as portraying him carrying an infant on his back,[7] while others had excessive detail, such as hair and other "flowing things".[7]<br>



Early concept art by Kratos' original designer/creator Charlie Wen, depicting unused variations of Kratos (although the variations were later used in God of War III as bonus costumes).
Charlie Wen, director of visual development on God of War (2005) and God of War II, was responsible for designing Kratos. Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture, which led him to conceive Kratos on a series of napkins at a restaurant, having forgotten his sketchbook, introducing the idea of the double-chained blades and eventually Kratos' iconic design.[8][9] Double-chained blades were chosen as Kratos' signature weapon because they emphasized the character's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid.[10] Wen visualized the double-chained blades activating simultaneously as Kratos threw them with a balance of ferocity and accuracy. Jaffe said of the final version of the character, "[Kratos] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head."[11]<br>

Wen gave Kratos his most noticeable feature, his ash-white complexion, a story development that earns him the title "Ghost of Sparta."[12] Other distinctive features include a scar across his right eye, and a large, red tattoo that threads from his left eye, circles his left torso, and ends at his left shoulder. The tattoo was originally blue, but was changed late in production.[13] In the series lore, the scar is eventually revealed to be the result of a childhood encounter with the Olympian God, Ares, while the tattoo is a tribute to his dead brother Deimos, who had similar birth markings.[14] Other changes that occur during the course of the Greek era of the series include the temporary addition of divine armor when Kratos is the God of War, an abdominal scar, ability-enhancing armor such as an epaulet called the Golden Fleece (all God of War II), and the Boots of Hermes (God of War III). According to an early God of War script, the character is 7 feet 0 inches (2.13 m) tall,[15] but this was later changed when Santa Monica Studios and Gnomon School delved deeper into the animation and rigging history of the games, showing Greek Kratos to be 2.34 metres (7 ft 8 in) tall, with Norse Kratos being 1.94 metres (6 ft 4 in) tall and weighing in at roughly 250 pounds (110 kg).[16] In 2018's God of War, the designers gave Kratos a more Nordic look, including a full beard. They also changed his main weapon to a magical battle axe to make the combat more grounded. Unlike previous games, players can change and upgrade Kratos' three different armor pieces, one of the game's various RPG elements.[2]<br>

Kratos' appearance throughout the Greek games can be altered in bonus play; completing the game at certain levels of difficulty and in challenge modes unlock bonus costumes. Several costumes were available exclusively via pre-order and other promotions (e.g. God of War III, which features three costumes based on early sketches of the character) from the PlayStation Store.[17] Although many bonus costumes are consistent with story themes, others are humorous or farcical—such as the female costume "Athena" and the "Spud of War".[18]<br>

The character was given his name at a late stage in the development of the original game after the character had already been fleshed out.[19] Unaware of the actual mythological god named Kratos appearing in Prometheus Bound, the creators coincidentally chose Kratos, the same Greek word meaning "Strength", of which the mythological figure is the personification.[20][19] Stig Asmussen, who worked on the first two games and was game director of God of War III, called the naming coincidence a "happy mistake",[19] noting that the Kratos in the game and the one in Prometheus Bound are both "pawns".[19] Zoran Iovanovici of California State University, Long Beach observed with irony that, while the mythological Kratos is best known for chaining Prometheus, in God of War II, the video game character releases him.[19] Classical scholar Sylwia Chmielewski states that the video game character Kratos draws extensively on other figures from Greek mythology, including the heroes Perseus, Theseus, and Achilles,[21][22] but his strongest influence is the hero Heracles (Roman Hercules), who appears in God of War III with the Romanized name and is the character's half-brother.[21]<br>

For 2018's God of War, game director Cory Barlog explained that Kratos had to change his cycle of violence and learn how to control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change.[2] The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence.[23] The bond between Kratos and his son is at the heart of the game and Barlog said "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, "We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of [Bruce] Banner now."[24]<br>

Voice and actor portrayal
Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaced T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the 2018 game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War. Commenting in response to the change, Carson said, "Sony went in a new direction."[25] In explaining the actor change, Barlog said that the way the previous games were made, they were able to have someone else do the motion capture instead of the voice actor. Although Carson had done the motion capture for Kratos in Ascension, Barlog said the actor change was made because of the type of camera work they wanted to do. For the new camera work, they needed someone who was closer to Kratos' size to do the motion capture along with 10-year-old Sunny Suljic, who played Kratos' son Atreus. Carson was unsuitable for this because he was much shorter than Kratos, who is over 6-feet tall: "Offsetting [Carson's height] for the size of a child, it turned out it was going to be almost impossible to try and actually shoot them and go in and redo the animations." Judge was chosen because he was 6-foot-3 and had the body of a professional football player. In stepping into the role of Kratos, Judge took it as an opportunity to add something new to the character. He researched the character and Carson's performance but decided not to imitate it. Since Santa Monica was going in a new direction, he decided to start fresh.[26]<br>

Prior to beginning work on Ragnarök, Judge briefly quit the game after finding out that Eric Williams would be directing the sequel. Judge was uncertain about Williams; however, Barlog, who served as a producer and creative director on Ragnarök, was able to convince Judge that Williams was fully capable of directing the game, which Judge affirmed after working with him.[27]<br>

Backstory and comics (past)
Main article: God of War (DC Comics)
Throughout the series, Kratos is portrayed as an antihero,[28] often performing questionable actions. Although his backstory is seen in the original God of War, Kratos' childhood is revealed in Ghost of Sparta and the birth of his daughter is explored in the God of War comic series (2010–11). In Ghost of Sparta, it is revealed that the oracle had foretold that the demise of Olympus would not happen by the hands of the Titans—imprisoned after the Great War—but rather by a mortal, a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus, Athena, and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, Kratos' younger brother, who had a strange birthmark. Ares and Athena interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos in Sparta and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but Ares swept him aside and scarred him across his right eye. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured for many years by the god of death, Thanatos. Believing Deimos to be dead, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark, to honor his siblings.[14]<br>

Through flashbacks in the comic series (2010–11) written by Marv Wolfman, Kratos meets his wife Lysandra and they have a daughter named Calliope. Upon birth, Calliope was stricken with the plague. In order to save his daughter, Kratos was granted a quest to find the Ambrosia of Asclepius, an elixir with magical healing properties. Five of the gods entered into a wager with Ares: each chose a champion to search for the Ambrosia with Ares' champion being Kratos. Kratos overcame all obstacles, including, among others, Hades' champion, the Barbarian Prince Alrik who eventually became the Barbarian King, and thus Kratos saved his daughter.[29][30][31]<br>

Via flashbacks in God of War, it is revealed that Kratos became the youngest captain of Sparta's army (also shown in the 2010–11 comic series), but had a thirst for power. When Kratos was faced with total defeat at the hands of a barbarian horde led by the Barbarian King, the Spartan called to the Olympian god Ares for aid. Kratos was given the Blades of Chaos, destroyed his enemies, and blindly followed Ares, killing hundreds in his name. After Ares tricked Kratos into murdering his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope in a temple dedicated to Athena, the Spartan was shocked out of his bloodlust and renounced service to Ares. As the temple burned, a village oracle cursed Kratos and condemned him to wear the "mark of his terrible deed"; the ashes of his family, which turn his skin pale white, earning him the title "Ghost of Sparta".[32]<br></h2><img src="D:\GOW OF WAR\kratos and atres.jpg"height="400px"><img><br><br>
