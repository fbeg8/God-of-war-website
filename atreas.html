		<h1>Loki (Nordic: ᛚᛟᚲᛁ), also known as Atreus (Greek: Ἀτρεύς), is the Norse God of Mischief and the Champion of the Jötnar. He is the deuteragonist of God of War (2018) and the secondary protagonist of God of War: Ragnarök.

Atreus is introduced as the son of Kratos and Faye. Together with his father, they embark on a journey to spread his deceased mother's ashes on top of the highest peak in all the nine realms. On their journey, Kratos teaches Atreus how to survive and fight as a warrior while Atreus teaches Kratos to open up to those that can help them.</center>

<h1>As Atreus and Kratos reach Jötunheim to spread Faye's ashes on the Giant Finger's mountain, they learn that she was a Jötunn. As Atreus wonders about his heritage, he also learns that his mother gave him the birth name 'Loki'.

During Fimbulwinter, Atreus seeks answers about his Jötunn heritage, something Kratos cannot answer. This makes Atreus secretly partner up with Sindri to reexamine the Jötnar shrines, where they learn that a God of War and Champion will be of great importance during Ragnarök. As Kratos finds out about Atreus' secret activities, he reluctantly agrees to help him, hoping to prevent Ragnarök.

After Atreus reconciles with his father, he manages to infiltrate Asgard and steal Odin's most prized possession, a mask with infinite knowledge. At Sindri’s house, it is revealed that Týr have been Odin in disguise and kills Brok. As the group manages to drive Odin away and retrieve the mask, they decide to start Ragnarök in order to bring Odin to justice for his crimes against the Nine Realms.

Atreus, Kratos, Freya, and Mimir have a final battle with Odin, resulting in Atreus killing Odin by trapping his soul. Odin is then denied an afterlife by a vengeful Sindri. As Fimbulwinter ends, Atreus makes his way through the survivors to tell Angrboda and his father that he is going explore the lands outside of the Nine Realms hoping to find the rest of the giants, having decided that his identity is both Loki & Atreus simultaneously.<img src="D:\GOW OF WAR\atreus last.jpg"height="400px"><img><br><br></h1>
